        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
        </li>
        <li>
            30 Savoiardi ladyfinger sponges
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make the espresso coffee and add to a medium bowl. Add the Kahlua (if using). Set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Over your stove, set up a small saucepan of gently simmering water. Add the egg yolks and sugar to a large, heat-proof bowl that will fit snugly over the saucepan without allowing steam to escape.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the bowl carefully over the saucepan, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the boiling water. Using electric beaters (or a whisk), continually beat the yolks and sugar over the heat until they become pale, fluffy and roughly double in volume. Allow to cool slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using electric beaters on low speed, add the mascarpone and vanilla bean paste to the egg yolk mixture and beat until stiff.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the coffee, Savoiardi ladyfinger sponges and a 18 X 29 cm tray on a bench, ready to assemble.
        </li>
        <li>
            Working quickly, dip each side of the sponge fingers into the coffee and Kahlua mixture. * Only dip for 1 second each side, as too long will cause them to become too soggy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow any excess coffee to drip from the sponges and assemble them in a single layer in the bottom of the dish. If there are any gaps, cut some sponge fingers to fit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread half of the mascarpone mixture evenly over the top of the sponge layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat this process with a final layer of coffee soaked sponges. For the final layer, either spread or pipe the remaining mascarpone over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight is best).
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or some dark chocolate shavings, if you prefer.
        </li>
    </ol>
